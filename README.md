2. [Create a bootable image](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/ev34j-mindstorm-tutorial/wiki/Create-a-bootable-image-for-the-EV3) of the [ev3dev](http://www.ev3dev.org) Linux distro on an SD card.

## Download the repo 

You have two options for downloading the repo:

1. [Clone](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/ev34j-mindstorm-tutorial/wiki/Clone-the-EV34J-Mindstorm-Tutorial-repo) it.
2. [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/ev34j-mindstorm-tutorial/wiki/Fork-and-clone-the-EV34J-Mindstorm-Tutorial-repo) it.

Just cloning it is easier, but it will not allow you to push your changes back to github, 
which the fork and clone option does.
